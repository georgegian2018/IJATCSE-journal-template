# Git Basics – Command Line

## Overview
This article explains the basic Git workflow when using the command line,
including how repositories are created and how changes are tracked.

## Who This Is For
Engineers, researchers, and technical users who are new to Git.

## Key Concepts
- Repository
- Commit
- Local vs Remote repository
- Branch

## Typical Workflow
A typical Git workflow includes:
1. Initializing a repository
2. Tracking file changes
3. Saving changes as commits
4. Synchronizing with a remote repository

## Explanation
Initializing a repository creates a hidden Git database that records
changes to files over time.

Tracking changes allows Git to identify which files should be included
in the next snapshot.

Committing saves a snapshot of the project at a specific point in time.

## Common Questions
**Why do I need to commit?**  
Commits allow you to return to previous states of your project.

**What happens if I forget to push?**  
Your changes remain local and are not shared.
