# Antennas

## Overview
An antenna is a device that converts electrical signals into electromagnetic
waves and vice versa.

## Why Antennas Matter
Antennas play a critical role in wireless communication systems by
determining radiation patterns, efficiency, and coverage.

## Common Antenna Types
- Dipole antennas
- Patch antennas
- Array antennas

## Key Characteristics
- Gain
- Radiation pattern
- Bandwidth
- Polarization

## Where to Learn More
Standard antenna textbooks and peer-reviewed literature provide
deeper theoretical treatment.
